#  Agentic AI Lab

This repo is my personal lab for **testing research ideas around AI Agents vs Agentic AI**.  
It contains **toy datasets, simple agents, and experiments** to measure the differences between:
- A plain AI agent (stateless, single-task).
- An “Agentic AI” system (with memory, planning, orchestration).

The project is inspired by the Sapkota et al. (2025) paper: *AI Agents vs Agentic AI: A Conceptual Taxonomy*.  
The goal is to **validate claims with small experiments** and publish results openly.
